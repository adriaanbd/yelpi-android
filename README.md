# Yelpi Android

**Currently in active development.**

> A React Native front end to a healthcare app wherein a caretaker can register patients they care for, along with their health data inputs, i.e. medication, blood pressure, mental state, physical state, and medical condition, among others. The patient profile information could be shared with a family member or a doctor by means of a link or access token.

## Built With
